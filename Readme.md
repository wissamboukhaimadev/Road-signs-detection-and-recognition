# Road signs detection and recognition using Pytorch and YOLO

## python setup

make sure you have python 3.9 and python 3.12 installed on your machine, and renaming the python 3.12 environement variable to be python3_12

to do that:

navigate to where you installed python3.12
for me it's in

```
C:\Users\{user_name}\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312
```

and change the name from **python.exe** to **python3_12.exe**

then install python 3.9 normally

then, open terminal and paste this command

```
python3_12.exe -m pip install torch
```

the web server implementation will be hosted on the future, stay tuned ðŸ™‚

## LabVIEW setup

for the module path controller make sure to use the labview.py script from the yolov5 directory

for the image path. use whatever the image you want
